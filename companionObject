we don't use the word static in kotlin

we cannot call it in another class ( another file )

class A {
  companion object {
    
      fun printHello(){
        sout("hey")
      }
    
  }

}

so to make it static and useful in all the packages
we must use the annoation @JVMStatic

and this annotation is only useful in the object or the companion object

this implements the factory pattern
we create a function in the companion object 

companion object {
  fun createObject : A = A()
}
