for variables 

val : only read / var : reassigned and read

types in kotlin are non nullable by default

String? to make it nullable	

val nickNameToPrint = nickName ?: "no nickname" 
// ?: called the Elvis operator
( if nickName is null it will return no nickname otherwise the same value )

internal classes are just visible within the same module

interfaces can have default implementation

property initializers are not allowed in interfaces ( like if you have 
a string as a var )

class Impl : interface1 , interface 2 

by default classes are final are not inhertited

we must add the key open !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

class subClass : class(){
}

and the class should contain the key "open"
